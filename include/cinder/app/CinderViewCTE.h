// CinderViewCTE (Cocoa Touch Embedded)
// A CinderView meant to be instantiated in a NIB or by hand that exists
// within a normal CocoaTouch app.
// It can be attached to an MultiTouchApp, which would simply hum along
// independently from the rest of the CocoaTouch app, happily filling the 
// CinderViewCTE with wonderful Cinder content.
